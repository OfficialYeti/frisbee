### Multitenancy. 

Multi-tenant architecture is a design approach that enables multiple user groups — referred to as tenants — access to one instance of an application or system. This is much like an apartment building, where various tenants have their own apartments. All the apartments are private and secure but share the same infrastructure.

1. Stateless API is standard so it shouldn't be a problem
2. Need to remember about culture info depending on tenant users region. 
3. How to design persistance layer? 
4. How to onboard a new tenant? 

The fourth point is what i should focus on. 

There is a nice microsoft docs regarding this topic here:

...and from now i will study that.
